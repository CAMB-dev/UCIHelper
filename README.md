The first time you enter, the data set list will be downloaded automatically. If you want to cache it, please use the cache command after the initialization is completed. The instructions contained in this program are as follows:

| listall  | Lists all datasets |
| listallc  | Lists all datasets from the cache file |
| cache  | Caches the dataset list to a file |
| search {keyword}  | Search keywords, fuzzy search is not supported |
| getres {full dataset name}  | Get some basic information about the dataset |
| exit  | Exit the program |

This may the last thing I leave. Goodbye.
